general

- code compiles: 1 (out of 1)
Should be in package logic.

- javadoc comment at the start of the class: 0 (out of 0.5)

- javadoc for the constructor: 0.5 (out of 0.5)
Use /** instead of /*.

- javadoc for the toString method: 0.5 (out of 0.5)

- uses descriptive names for the fields and variables: 0.5 (out of 0.5)

constructor

- initializes the field: 1 (out of 1)

equals method

- handles the case that the argument is null: 0.5 (out of 0.5)

- checks if the subformulas are equal: 0.5 (out of 0.5)

hashCode method

- uses the hash code of the subformula: 1 (out of 1)

toString method

- return the correct string (including the space following EX): 1 (out of 1)

sat method

- passes the basic tests: 0 (out of 1)

- passes the intermediate tests: 0 (out of 1)

- passes the advanced tests: 0 (out of 1)

- invokes the sat method of the subformula correctly: 1 (out of 1)

- invokes the post method correctly: 1 (out of 1)

- iterates over all states: 1 (out of 1)

- uses the post correctly (e.g., using intersects): 0 (out of 1)
